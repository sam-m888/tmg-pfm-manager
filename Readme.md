---------------------

For those of you who use some of TMG's advanced feature Data_paths.txt here is a (dos) bat file that I wrote for myself that I would like to share.

The batch file allows you to manage separate tmg projects using Data_paths.txt. It does this by overwriting Data_paths.txt with previously set up Data_paths.txt files.

See TMG7's help file for more information about Data_paths.txt

You need to be familiar with DOS batch file and know how to move files around windows.

Enjoy
